# Haptic-Needle-Insertion
Many doctors donâ€™t have sufficient dummy training and train on living patients, this represents risks to the patients as mistakes could happen. Especially since these needles mainly happen during surgical procedures and a mistake can cause loss of life.  Thus, we decided on making a dummy training for doctors to aid them in their learning processes.

The haptic needle simulation aims to do that. 

The simulator takes input from the user via the needle movement, the output is felt by the user. That feeling is what helps training the doctors.
